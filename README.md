 The provided Python code implements a simple task manager using object-oriented programming principles and file I/O operations. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. *TaskManager Class*:
   - The TaskManager class serves as the main component for managing tasks.
   - It contains methods for loading tasks from a file, saving tasks to a file, adding tasks, removing tasks, marking tasks as completed, and listing tasks.

2. *File I/O Operations*:
   - The load_tasks method loads tasks from a JSON file named "tasks.json" if it exists.
   - The save_tasks method saves tasks to the same JSON file after any modifications.

3. *Task Management Operations*:
   - add_task: Adds a new task to the list of tasks with specified attributes such as title, priority, due date, and initial completion status.
   - remove_task: Removes a task from the list based on its index.
   - mark_task_completed: Marks a task as completed based on its index.
   - list_tasks: Lists all tasks along with their status (completed/pending), title, priority, and due date.

4. *Main Functionality*:
   - The main function serves as the entry point of the program.
   - It creates an instance of TaskManager, loads tasks from the file, and presents a menu to the user.
   - Users can choose from options such as adding tasks, removing tasks, marking tasks as completed, listing tasks, or exiting the program.
   - Input validation ensures that users provide valid choices and indices.

5. *User Interaction*:
   - The program interacts with users through the command line interface (CLI) by displaying menu options and requesting input for various operations.

Overall, the code provides a basic framework for managing tasks efficiently through a simple and intuitive interface. It can be extended and customized further to suit specific requirements or integrated into larger applications as a modular component









The provided Python script implements a basic budget tracker program. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. *Main Functionality* (main function):
   - Presents a menu to the user with options to add transactions, view remaining budget, view expense analysis, or exit the program.
   - Continues running in a loop until the user chooses to exit.

2. *Data Loading and Saving*:
   - load_transactions function reads existing transaction data from a JSON file named "transactions.json" if it exists, otherwise initializes an empty dictionary.
   - save_transactions function writes the current transaction data to the same JSON file.

3. *Adding Transactions* (add_transaction function):
   - Prompts the user to input transaction details such as category, amount, and type (income or expense).
   - Updates the income or adds an expense to the list of expenses based on the transaction type.

4. *Viewing Remaining Budget* (view_budget function):
   - Calculates the remaining budget by subtracting the total expenses from the total income.
   - Displays the remaining budget to the user.

5. *Viewing Expense Analysis* (view_expense_analysis function):
   - Analyzes expenses by category, calculating the total amount spent in each category.
   - Displays the expense analysis to the user.

6. *Error Handling*:
   - Handles invalid input by informing the user and prompting them to try again.

This script provides users with essential tools to manage their budget, allowing them to track income, expenses, and analyze spending patterns by category. Additionally, it ensures data persistence by saving transactions to a file for future use.
